scraping
========

this is a scraper of NFL data as a personal introduction to node.js and scraping. this uses cherrio.

noobjecttest.js is the first stable file allowing multiple inputs (run as 'node noobjecttest.js *test* *year*)
where test can be receiverPercentage, recYardsPerAttempt, or distanceDownfield. year can be any integer, although any year less than 2002 or greater than 2013 will revert to 2013.

qbtest is an expansion that will provide receiver or qb data depending on input
